# Spec Map

Quick-reference index for locating spec files.
Spec items are the source of truth.
Code can be inconsistent with specs during development.

## Layout

```text
decisions/  Decision records (DRs)
iterations/ Iteration records (IRs)
items/      Spec item files
    user/       User-visible behavior
    dev/        Implementation requirements
    test/       Acceptance testing
map.md      This index
meta.md     The spec of specs
```

## Iterations
